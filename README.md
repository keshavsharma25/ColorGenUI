ColorGenUI is a simple and easy to use interface that allows you to generate colors based on the image you upload. I used Vanilla JavaScript and CSS to create this interface. It was then hosted on Netlify. I used [ColorGen](https://colorgenapi.herokuapp.com/docs) API to generate colors. The github for the API is [here](https://github.com/keshavsharma25/ColorGenAPI).
